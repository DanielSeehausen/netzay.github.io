When I was in the eigth grade, I wanted to be a veterinarian, I absolutely loved and still do love animals.  Life, or I, myself ended up getting in the way of that plan.  Coming out of highschool, college was the last thing on my mind so it took a few years of what I call nonsense for me to realize I wanted and needed to get a college degree.  I re-programmed a Windows computer when I was 17, really had no idea what I was doing, but I did it, and loved it.  Looking back now, all I did was put the Windows operating system disc in and eventually run the setup correctly to get it to boot, but even still, the programming bug was planted.  

In my mid twenties, I gave myself a choice.  I was either going to pursue a degree in computer programming or veterinary technology, because 8 years of veterinary school seemed way out of my league at the time.  Choosing the easier and quicker route, I decided to attend a local community college to complete the veterinary technician program.  I graduated and worked at a local general practice animal clinic for almost a year and was miserable the last 6 months.  When I discovered I was incredibly bored and the veterinarian had the challenging job, I realized it was time to go back to school again for computer science.  

I then attended Colorado State University for two semesters, having a heck of a time attempting to learn how to program through their method of teaching java.  Needless to say it was not a good experience so I switched gears again to get an online bachelors degree in information technology with a specialization in cyber security.  I started working at a software company in security and compliance while finishing my degree.   Eventually discovering yet again that I would prefer to write code than to work in a security related position.

I began going through online tutorials, such as Freecodecamp, Codecademy,  taking courses on Coursera and various other online tools but wasn't making much progress.  I loved learning bits and pieces of the different languages and really couldn't get enough.  Being a school nerd, avid learner and seeker of structure, it was again time to go back to school.  

Instantly after I began the Full Stack Web Development program at Flatirons School I realized how much I love the challenge of writing code everyday and have found that I can not get enough most days.  On top of that, the opportunities are endless, the learning will be lifelong and I know now I will likely never run out of the challenges I thrive on.  I belive I have found my passion.
