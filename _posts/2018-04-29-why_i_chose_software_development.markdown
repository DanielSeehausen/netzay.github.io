Back when I was in middle school, eigth grade to be precise, I wanted to be a veterinarian, I absolutely loved and still do love animals.  Life, or I, myself ended up getting in the way of that plan.  Coming out of highschool, college was the last thing on my mind so it took a few years of what I call nonsense for me to realize I wanted and needed to get a college degree.  I re-programmed a Windows computer when I was 17, really had no idea what I was doing but I did it and loved it.  Looking back now, all I did was put the Windows operating system disc in and eventually run the setup correctly to get it to boot, but even still, the programming bug was planted.  

I decided to attend a local community college to complete the veterinary technician program, worked at a general practice, animal clinic for about a year, but found the job lacked greatly in the challenge my brain thrives on.  I then started doing tutorials online using the different free programs and tools available.  Months later, I found this approach lacked the structure and curriculum I so love about school.  I learned quite a bit from the different tutorials and random courses I completed but I wanted something concrete to work towards and complete.  Once I began the Full Stack Web Development program at Flatirons School I realized how much I love the challenge of writing code.  The opportunities are endless, the learning lifelong and I know now I will never run out of challenges.
